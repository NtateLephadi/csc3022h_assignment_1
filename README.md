The objective of this tutorial is to build a simple database of student records, which can be queried for student information. The database will consist of fixed size records which contain student details. You will first need to set up the source code framework/structure and build a simple menu-based interface. After youâ€™ve successfully done this you can fill in the details by implementing all database functionality. The database will not be sorted or indexed since this requires more complex algorithms and data structures. This is an exploratory tutorial, intended to give you some experience with basic C++ coding
